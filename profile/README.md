# Air Pollution Group at ISGlobal

Welcome! This is the GitHub Organization site for the research group led by Cathryn Tonne at ISGlobal. All analyses from the group should be versioned controlled and stored under this site.

>**Important**: Confidential data should not be stored in GitHub and therefore should not be version controlled. Contact the GitHub Organization's maintainer when in doubt.

## Getting Started



### Creating a new repository

1. Create a new private GitHub repo in this organization using the available template at [repo-template](https://github.com/isglobal-airpollution/repo-template).

2. Clone this remote repository inside the appropriate network folder path in your machine. If using RStudio, use *`File > New Project > Version Control > Git`*.

3. Add appropriate data folder to your local repo if necessary.

4. Work on the analysis locally commiting when significant changes/additions have been made.

5. Push your commits to the remote repository regularly.


### Adding an existing Git repository

1. Make sure the possibly sensitive data in your existing project has not been version controlled at any stage.

2. Create an *empty* GitHub repository with the same name as your existing project directory.

3. Connect local repo to GitHub repo.

4. Push to the GitHub repo.
