# Air Pollution Group at ISGlobal

Welcome!

All analyses should be versioned controlled and stored under this GitHub Organization site.

## Getting Started

### Creating a new repository

GitHub first:

1. Create a new private repo in this organization using the available template at [repo-template](https://github.com/isglobal-airpollution/repo-template).

2. Clone the repository inside the appropriate network folder path in your machine.

3. Add appropriate data folder to your local repo if necessary.

4. Work on the analysis locally commiting when significant changes/additions have been made.

5. Push your commits to the remote repository regularly.

6. Make your repo public for sharing if appropriate.
